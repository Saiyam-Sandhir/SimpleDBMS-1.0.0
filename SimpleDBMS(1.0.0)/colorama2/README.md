hey there i am saiyam jain the author of the package.
i simply created it as i was facing some problems with the actual coloram package as it was returning errors for IDLE,
please be gentle don't critize me much i am new to python and is my first package i have created, may you like it.
it allows you to see wether colorama is supported or not and as per gives color and styles that colorama provides if there is not problem in importing colorama else returns the simple text so might get diffent outputs in different platforms like jupyter or IDLE, etc.
thank you :)
